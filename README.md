# Day 8 - Stopwatch App ⏱️

This is Day 8 of my 30-Day React Relearning Journey. The focus of this project is to:

- Handle time-based operations using `setInterval`
- Manage side effects and clean-up with `useEffect`
- Use `useRef` to persist values without causing re-renders
- Build a responsive stopwatch with Start, Stop, and Reset functionality

---

## 🚀 What I Learned

✅ How to use `setInterval` to track time  
✅ How to stop and reset timers using `clearInterval`  
✅ How `useRef` can hold mutable values across renders  
✅ How to format seconds into `mm:ss` display  
✅ Importance of clean-up in `useEffect` to prevent memory leaks
